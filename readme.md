# Headless UI Web Components

This is an experimental and **unofficial** port of [tailwindlabs/headlessui](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui) to standalone Web Components using Stencil.

## Getting Started

To try the demo, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrcrayon/headlessui-webcomponents.git headlessui-webcomponents
cd headlessui-webcomponents
npm install
npm start
```

To build the components for production run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Using components

## About Stencil

Stencil is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool. Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.
